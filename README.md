## ðŸŽª Welcome to the Circus

### ðŸ”’ The Pink Prisoner [@third-time-charm/lockedin](https://davidyen1124.github.io/third-time-charm/lockedin)

Behold, a 3D masterpiece where a pink humanoid is forever trapped in a cylindrical cage! Built with Three.js because apparently, 2D wasn't complicated enough. Watch in amazement as our blocky friend eternally rotates like a sad display item at a department store. Features include: anatomically questionable proportions, a hairstyle that defies gravity, and enough geometry to make Euclid proud.

### ðŸ›¹ The Physics-Defying Dude [@third-time-charm/hoverboard](https://davidyen1124.github.io/third-time-charm/hoverboard)

Meet our orange-bodied, pink-headed friend who's living his best life on a blue hoverboard. Thanks to some questionable physics calculations, he bounces around like a caffeinated kangaroo on a trampoline. Watch as random torque forces make him dance like he's at a rave, all while pretending that this is totally how hoverboards should work. Warning: May trigger flashbacks to your high school physics class.
