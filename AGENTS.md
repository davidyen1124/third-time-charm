# Repository Instructions

- If you edit any file under `src/pages` or `README.md`, you **must** also update `README.md` with a brief, funny, sarcastic blurb about the change.
- Always run `npm run format` and `npm run lint` before committing.
- Keep humor and sarcasm consistent with the existing README style.
- When adding or removing a demo page under `src/pages`, make sure `src/pages/Index.jsx` reflects the change so the gallery stays in sync.
