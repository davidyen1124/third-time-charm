🚨 READ THIS BEFORE YOU JUDGE 🚨

Hey there! 👋 So you found this React app. Congrats!
You're probably the first person besides my IDE to actually read this code.

What can you do with this code?
✅ Copy it (but why would you?)
✅ Modify it (it can't get worse)
✅ Share it (spread the chaos)
✅ Sell it (good luck with that)
✅ Blame it for your existential crisis
✅ Use it as an example of what not to do

What you can't do:
❌ Complain about the code quality (we know)
❌ Ask why everything is a React component
❌ Question the number of dependencies
❌ Point out that this could've been done in vanilla JS
❌ Say "jQuery could do this better"

WARNINGS:

- Side effects include headaches, confusion, and sudden urges to rewrite everything in Svelte
- Contains more useState than actual state management
- May cause senior developers to cry
- Dependencies are more unstable than my coffee intake
- 60% of the time, it works every time

SUPPORT PLAN:

- You break it = you buy me coffee
- I break it = you still buy me coffee
- It actually works = definitely buy me coffee

Remember: This app was made with ❤️, 🍕, and concerning amounts of caffeine.

P.S. If this code somehow makes it into production, I want that story framed on my wall.
