# Formatting and Linting

This project uses **Prettier** for code formatting and **ESLint** for linting.

## Running the formatter

```bash
npm run format
```

This command runs Prettier on the entire project, rewriting files in place.

## Running the linter

```bash
npm run lint
```

This command checks the codebase using ESLint and reports any issues.
